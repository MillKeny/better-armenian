Better and Correct Armenian Translation for Minecraft.  
**Tested and better worked on 1.21.8**. But still, you can install it on 1.13-1.21.7, but correct text displaying is not guaranteed (For older versions - wait for news)

## Installation
Installed as a regular resource pack. After that the language menu will have the new Armenian option
